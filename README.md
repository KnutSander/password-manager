# Password Manager
My own implementation of a password manager in .NET and C#.

I haven't used .NET before, so this will be an exciting project to figure it out with :)

## Requirements
Features and functionality:
- Create, read, update and delete usernames/emails and password combinations for different websites
- Authentication using GitHub credentials + MFA

## Model
- One user per instance
- One or more entries per web page or application

## Data Storage
- Data is stored in private GitHub repo (for now)
- Store in Azure in the future
    - Look into this further, what storage service to use etc.
